# Tenable-IPList
This script just grabs the latest Tenable cloud scanner list, saving the results to a plain text file.  The output is appropriate for many firewalls and security applications to consume directly.

## Running
1. Edit $OutputFilename to specify where you want the output IP list to be saved.
2. Run TenableIPs.ps1 from an account with write/modify privileges to the output file location.
